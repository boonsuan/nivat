# Boundary cost and unique extension

The counting part of Lemma 5.5 (`lem:boundary-window`) and the fiber count in
Lemma 5.7 (`lem:periodic-interior`) of `paper/nivat.tex`. Restriction is a
surjection on occurring patterns. A small total increase forces a zero increase
at one boundary site, and the total excess of fiber sizes bounds the number of
interior patterns with more than one boundary extension.
